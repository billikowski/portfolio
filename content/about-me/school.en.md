Here I describe my school career. Of course, learning doesn't end for me after successfully visiting the three schools. My bachelor degree followed after my high school graduation at the Gewerbliche Schule in Künzelsau.

- **Elementary School in Niedernhall** (2005-2009)  
  I went to the elementary school in my home town Niedernhall. This prepared me for attending a high school, even though the recommendation for this was only narrowly achieved.
- **High school Ganerben Gymnasium Künzelsau** (2009-2014)  
  I went to the Ganerben Gymnasium from the fifth to the ninth grade. Here I had classes in "French" and in "Science and Technology" (among other classes). However, I already noticed my special passion for technology here, for example while programming an 8-bit microcontroller in the programming language `BASIC`.
- **High school Gewerblichen Schule in Künzelsau** (2014-2017)  
  The Technical High School with the profile "Technology and Management" now allowed me to strengthen my interest in modern technologies, especially computer technology but also industrial production. It was now obvious for me to pursue a degree in the field of computer science, which started in 2017.
